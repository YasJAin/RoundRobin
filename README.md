# RoundRobin
THIS FILE CONTAINS THE CODE WHICH CAN BE USED TO IMPLEMENT THE ROUND ROBIN PROCESS SCEDULING ALGORITHM IN THE C++ LANGUAGE.

ROUND ROBIN IS A PREMPTIVE(AKA A KIND OF PROCESS THAT WOULD BE OPEN TO HAVE INTERRUPTS OR PROCESSING OF OTHER PROCESSES BETWEEN A PARTICULAR PROCESS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE OPTIMALITY AND REDUCE THE WAITING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF ALL INSTRUCTIONS) SCHEDULING ALGORITHM USED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF THE CPU TO PROCESS A PROCESS OR LIGHTWEIGHT SYSTEM FUNCTIONS SUCH AS OPENING AND CLOSING A FILE.

THE CODE IN THIS FILE DOESN'T SHOW THE ACTUAL ROUND ROBIN IMPLEMENTATION USED FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF A COMPUTER, RATHER JUST THE ALGORITHM AND THE PROCEDURE IN WHICH IT HAPPENS.

THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A ROUND ROBIN ALGORITHM IS TO MINIMISE THE AVERAGE WAITING TIME, OR THE AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN THE INPUT AND PROCESSING OF A PARTICUALR PROCESS.
